# General Practice with ODEs

The concept on how to build an ODE and how to solve it numerically is a fundamental concept in physics and also in biology. In this seminar, we will practice how to solve ODEs numerically using Python. We will use the `scipy` library to solve the ODEs.

The topic of the ODE that we will solve is the following:
    * exponential growth
    * logistic growth
    * predator-prey model (Lotka-Volterra model)
    * SIR model
    * Goodwin model

-> Application could be the circadian clock

And one additional thing that is part of it is the concept of bifurcation. We will also practice how to find the bifurcation points of the ODEs.

(Bonus practice is iterative function system (IFS))
